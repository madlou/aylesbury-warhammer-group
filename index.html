      <h1>Aylesbury Warhammer 40K &amp; AoS Group</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>The Facebook group was formed in August 2021 by a small group of 40K players looking for a new place to arrange
        games at each others homes, but quickly developed into a community that grew way beyond that.</p>
      <p>Our goal now is to be a central hub for all Warhammer hobby/gaming related content for anyone living in and
        around Aylesbury!</p>
      <p>Off the back of lockdown restrictions being lifted, there was a huge demand for us to create a regular meet-up
        and in November 2021 we secured an evening at a local community centre.</p>
      <h2>Committee Members</h2>
      <p>The committee members are currently pretty much made up by the original founding members, but will change
        annually.</p>
